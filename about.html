            <h2> Where we get our name</h2>
            <p>The name Paws4Thought came about after we decided that we wanted to set up our buisness. We were throwing around and nothing really stuck until Axel said that he was going to pause for thought. In that moment we all lokked at eachother and
                agreed that that was the perfect name. It co-insided withour ethos of thinking of the welfare for animals and people alike.
